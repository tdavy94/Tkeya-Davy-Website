	<h2>About T'keya</h2>
	<p>My name in <b>Tâ€™keya Davy</b> <i>(tuh-key-ah)</i> and I am a senior studying Communication Design and Digital Art at Elon University. I am originally from New Jersey and currently reside in Cary, NC. I am a non-traditional student because I transferred in after obtaining my Associate in Arts from Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, NC. I am interested in becoming a UX/UI Designer but mainly have interests in motion graphics and interactive media. I would like to eventually make interactive material for educational and training purposes one day.

		<br>
	I enjoy doing art in my spare time and incorporating artistic visuals in my media designs as well. I currently work as a metalsmith and am in the process of starting my own company, called <b>Enigma Wireworks</b>, where I make handmade, unique jewelry pieces. My primary job is as a sales and reservations agent for an airline, which I do part-time from home. Apart from working, being in school and doing art, I enjoy spending time with my dog Bailey, going to the beach, and traveling to experience new cultures and foods! </p>
